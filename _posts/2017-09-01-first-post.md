title: "Resolutions"
---

Hello new blog! As this is my first post, it'll probably take a while before I develop a consistent style. I consider this both a personal blog and a blog to detail my progress and academic growth. Hopefully I can post either weekly or bi-weekly and keep a record of my busy college life! For my first post I'll detail some resolutions and aspirations for this semester. Here's to hoping I reach my goals. 

Academic:
* Stay organized by keeping an updated calendar
* Develop effective, neat note-taking
* Study parts each week, as to not cram before a test
* Dedicate yourself to the career search/application process, doing the appropriate amount of research and preparation
* Develop positive relationships with professors
* Attend all class!
* Be in the top three for mechatronics competition
* Alter study habits to incorporate "teaching" to learn the topic better

Personal:
* Cook and pack more homemade meals, drink enough water each day
* Get more sleep! 
* Do not focus so much on what others are doing
* Appreciate more the people who are there for you
* Do not be so intimidated by others and their accomplishments or aura
